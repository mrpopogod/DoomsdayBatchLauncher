DoomsdayBatchLauncher
=====================
A simple utility for Steam games that use Dosbox to instead use a source port.  Notably Ultimate Doom, Heretic, and Hexen all hard launch Dosbox rather than the old method of launching a batch file in the SteamApps/common/<game> dir (Doom 2 still uses this old method).  This will instead divert to a batch file under <gamedir>/base which can then do the work of launching whatever source port you want.  I developed this because recent iterations of Doomsday try to do a lot of common configuration so I'd rather have it launch the Doomsday in Program Files rather than a renamed Doomsday in the game dir (not to mention not having to maintain versions on all the distributed copies and not going to the game selection when I pick a specific game).  It should be pretty obvious how it can be modified for other games.
